## What is Patternlab?

Patternlab is an open-source tool used to create styleguides.

- It comes in PHP and Node flavors
- NewCity has augmented it with our standard tooling

+++

### Patternlab conventions

- “Atoms, Molecules, Organisms”
- Should make creating new components easier
- Can use it to document the end product

+++

### Patternlab for CMS integration

- Easier to come up with test cases
- You can fake data backing (a bit)
- Copy/Paste CMS-generated code to write CSS to that

### Pattern organization

- Files are in `src/patterns/`
- Then “atoms,” “molecules,” “organisms,” “templates,” “pages”
- Then subgroups
- Numbers before names are optional, but help sort.
- Stylesheets mirror patterns (for the most part)
