# PatternLab and SCSS

---

## What is Patternlab?

Patternlab is an open-source tool used to create styleguides.

- It comes in PHP and Node flavors
- NewCity has augmented it with our standard tooling

+++

### Patternlab conventions

- “Atoms, Molecules, Organisms”
- Should make creating new components easier
- Can use it to document the end product

+++

### Patternlab for CMS integration

- Easier to come up with test cases
- You can fake data backing (a bit)
- Copy/Paste CMS-generated code to write CSS to that
